## Arrays 

### Sets v/s Arrays the if x in list v/s if x in set 

	•	The list approach checks for membership using a linear search, resulting in O(n^2) time complexity for the worst case.
	•	The set approach uses hash-based membership checks, achieving O(n) time complexity.

 ###

 when reducing the Big O speeed use sets instead of lists in array problems
